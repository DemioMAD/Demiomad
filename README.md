# What projects do I make?
***I have no idea.*** I just do random stuff and hope that it doesn't have terrible bugs.

I usually code in Python, but I sometimes do C# and JS.

My biggest project that's finished is [Demiochat+](https://github.com/DemioMAD/demiochatplus/)

One day I might release a bigger project. But that's not today.

```py
print("bye")
```
